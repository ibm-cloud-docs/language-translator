# Customizing your model
{: #customizing}

Most of the provided translation models in {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} can be extended to learn custom terms and phrases or a general style that's derived from your translation data. Follow these instructions to create your own custom translation model.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin}

1. Make sure that your {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} service instance is on an Advanced or Premium pricing plan. The Lite and Standard plans do not support customization.
1. Find a customizable base model for your language pair. You will need the model ID of the base model in order to train your custom model.
    - Search the models listed on the [Translation models](translation-models.html) page. Look for the value "**true**" in the **Customizable** column, and make sure the **Source** and **Target** languages of the model match your language pair.
    - Alternatively, you can use the [List models ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/language-translator/api/v2/#list-models) API method to search models programmatically. You can filter results by language with the `source` and `target` parameters.

## Step 1: Create your training data
{: #create-your-training-data}

The service requires training data to be provided in the [Translation Memory Exchange (TMX) file format](#creating-tmx-files). You can store up to 10 customizations per service instance. The service supports two types of customization requests. You can either customize a model with a forced glossary or with a corpus that contains parallel sentences.

- Use a [forced glossary](#forced-glossary-customization) to force certain terms and phrases to be translated in a specific way.
- Use a [parallel corpus](#parallel-corpus-customization) when you want your custom model to learn from general translation patterns in your samples. What your model learns from a parallel corpus can improve translation results for input text that the model hasn't been trained on.

After you have created your [Translation Memory Exchange (TMX) files](#creating-tmx-files), you're ready to train your model.

## Step 2: Train your model
{: #train-your-model}

Use the [Create model ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/language-translator/api/v3/curl.html#create-model) method to train your model. In your request, specify the model ID of a customizable base model, and training data in either the `forced_glossary` or `parallel_corpus` parameters.

### Example request
{: #train-model-example-request}

The following example request uses a forced glossary file, _glossary.tmx_, to customize the `en-es` base model. See the [Forced glossary customization](#forced-glossary) section for an example forced glossary TMX file.

```bash
curl --user apikey:{apikey} -X POST --form forced_glossary=@glossary.tmx "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/language-translator/api/v3/models?version=2018-05-01&base_model_id=en-es&name=custom-english-to-spanish"
```
{: pre}

The API response will contain details about your custom model, including its model ID. Use the model ID to check the status of your model, and to translate sentences once the status of the model becomes "available".

```json
{
  "model_id": "96221b69-8e46-42e4-a3c1-808e17c787ca",
  "source": "en",
  "target": "es",
  "base_model_id": "en-es",
  "domain": "general",
  "customizable": false,
  "default_model": false,
  "owner": "4937aab7-0f3a-4a75-bee1-0b7a12b6b8",
  "status": "uploaded",
  "name": "custom-english-to-spanish",
  "train_log": null
}
```
{: codeblock}

## Step 3: Check the status of your model
{: #check-model-status}

Model training might take anywhere from a couple of minutes (for forced glossaries) to several hours (for large parallel corpora) depending on how much training data is involved. To see if your model is available, use the [Get model ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/language-translator/api/v3/curl.html#get-model) method and specify the model ID that you received in the service response in Step 2. Also, you can check the status of all of your models with the [List models ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/language-translator/api/v3/curl.html#list-models) method.

The `status` response attribute describes the state of the model in the training process:

- `uploading`
- `uploaded`
- `dispatching`
- `queued`
- `training`
- `trained`
- `publishing`
- `available`

When the model status is `available`, your model is ready to use with your service instance. If your model is deleted, or if it encounters an error in the training process, you might see one of the following statuses:

- `deleted`
- `error`

### Example request
{: #check-model-example-request}

The following example gets information for the model identified by the model ID `96221b69-8e46-42e4-a3c1-808e17c787ca`.

```bash
curl --user apikey:{apikey_value} "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/language-translator/api/v3/models/96221b69-8e46-42e4-a3c1-808e17c787ca?version=2018-05-01"
```
{: pre}

## Step 4: Translate text with your custom model
{: #translate-text}

To use your custom model, specify the text that you want to translate and the custom model's model ID in the [Translate ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/language-translator/api/v3/curl.html#translate) method.

### Example request
{: #translate-text-example-request}

The following example translates text with the custom model identified by the model ID `96221b69-8e46-42e4-a3c1-808e17c787ca`.

```bash
curl --user apikey:{apikey_value} --request POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"text":"Hello","model_id":"96221b69-8e46-42e4-a3c1-808e17c787ca"}' https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/language-translator/api/v3/translate?version=2018-05-01
```
{: pre}


## Forced glossary customization
{: #forced-glossary-customization}

Use a **forced glossary** to set mandatory translations for specific terms and phrases. If you want specific control over translation behavior, use a forced glossary.

- Training data format: [TMX](#creating-tmx-files) (UTF-8 encoded)
- Maximum file size: 10 MB
- You can apply a forced glossary to a base model, or to a model that has been customized with a parallel corpus
- Limit one forced glossary per model

Forced glossary examples are sensitive to capitalization, so make sure that your training data reflects the capitalization of content that your application will encounter.
{: tip}

### Forced glossary example

The following example shows a TMX file with two translation pairs. The first pair forces "international business machines" to be preserved in English during translation. This type of forced translation might be useful if you want to preserve improperly capitalized company names in informal communications. The second pair forces the model to always use "brevet" when translating "patent".

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<tmx version="1.4">
  <header creationtool="" creationtoolversion=""
    segtype="phrase" o-tmf="" adminlang="en"
    srclang="en" datatype="PlainText" o-encoding="UTF-8" />
  <body>
    <tu>
      <tuv xml:lang="en">
        <seg>international business machines</seg>
      </tuv>
      <tuv xml:lang="fr">
        <seg>International Business Machines</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv xml:lang="en">
        <seg>patent</seg>
      </tuv>
      <tuv xml:lang="fr">
        <seg>brevet</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
  </body>
</tmx>
```
{: codeblock}



## Parallel corpus customization
{: #parallel-corpus-customization}

Use a **parallel corpus** to provide additional translations for the base model to learn from. This helps to adapt the base model to a specific domain. How the resulting custom model translates text depends on the model's combined understanding of the parallel corpus and the base model.

- Training data format: [TMX](#creating-tmx-files) (UTF-8 encoded)
- Minimum number of translation pairs: 5,000
- Maximum file size: 250 MB
- You can submit multiple parallel corpus files by repeating the `parallel_corpus` multipart form parameter as long as the cumulative size of the files doesn't exceed 250 MB.

### Parallel corpus example

The following is a small piece of an English to French parallel corpus that was downloaded from the [MultiUN collection ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://opus.nlpl.eu/MultiUN.php) available on the OPUS open parallel corpus website. You can download a compressed version of the entire TMX file [here ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://opus.nlpl.eu/download.php?f=MultiUN/en-fr.tmx.gz).


```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

          segtype="sentence"
          creationtool="Uplug"

          datatype="PlainText" />

    </tu>
    ...
```
{: codeblock}

The general improvements from parallel corpus customization are less predictable than the mandatory results you get from forced glossary customization. For example, consider the following translation unit from the example parallel corpus (lines 172-175).

```xml
<tu>
  <tuv xml:lang="en"><seg>55/102. Globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights</seg></tuv>
  <tuv xml:lang="fr"><seg>55/102. La mondialisation et ses effets sur le plein exercice des droits de l'homme</seg></tuv>
</tu>
```
{: codeblock}

If you translate "55/102. Globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights" with the base `en-fr` model, the service responds with the following translation.

```
55/102. La mondialisation et ses effets sur la pleine jouissance de tous les droits de l'homme
```
{: codeblock}

When the same input sentence is translated by a custom model trained with the example corpus, the service responds with a different translation that is not identical to the sample translation provided in the training data.

```
55/102. La mondialisation et ses effets sur le plein exercice de tous les droits de l'homme
```
{: codeblock}

- The custom model translates "the full enjoyment" to "le plein exercice" instead of "la pleine jouissance". The likely explanation for this deviation from the base model behavior is that there are many examples in the corpus where "enjoyment" is translated to "exercice".
- The custom model translates "of all human rights" to "de tous les droits de l'homme" instead of reproducing the result from the translation unit, "des droits de l'homme". This behavior reflects the trained model's cohesive understanding of the base model, and all of the translation samples that are related "of all human rights" from the parallel corpus.

In some cases it might seem that a custom model trained with a parallel corpus is ignoring a specific example that you provided. In these cases, try searching your training data for other sentences that might be influencing the translation behavior, or consider using a forced glossary if you want to control a specific translation.

## Creating TMX files
{: #creating-tmx-files}

To provide a glossary or corpus of terms for training the {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} service, create a valid UTF-8 encoded document that conforms to the Translation Memory Exchange (TMX) [version 1.4 ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.ttt.org/oscarStandards/tmx/){: new_window} specification. TMX is an XML specification that is designed for machine-translation tools. The following example is a TMX-formatted glossary file with two translation units (`<tu>` elements):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<tmx version="1.4">
  <header creationtool="" creationtoolversion=""
    segtype="sentence" o-tmf="" adminlang="EN"
    srclang="en" datatype="rtf" o-encoding="UTF-8" />
  <body>
    <tu>
      <tuv xml:lang="en">
        <seg>international business machines</seg>
      </tuv>
      <tuv xml:lang="fr">
        <seg>International Business Machines</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv xml:lang="en">
        <seg>patent</seg>
      </tuv>
      <tuv xml:lang="fr">
        <seg>brevet</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
  </body>
</tmx>
```
{: codeblock}

Each term and translation pair must be enclosed in `<tu>` tags:

```xml
<tu>
  <tuv xml:lang="en">
    <seg>international business machines</seg>
  </tuv>
  <tuv xml:lang="fr">
    <seg>International Business Machines</seg>
  </tuv>
</tu>
```
{: codeblock}

The`xml:lang` attribute in the `<tuv>` tag identifies the language in which a term is expressed, while the `<seg>` tag contains the term or the translation.

The {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} service uses only the `<tu>`, `<tuv>`, and `<seg>` elements. All other elements in the example are required to make a valid TMX file, or are informational, but are not used by the service.



### Using the example as a template

To use the provided example as a template for your own glossary or corpus, complete the following steps:

1. Copy and paste the example into a text editor.

1. Change the `srclang` attribute of the `<header>` tag to the [language code ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp){: new_window} of the source language that your glossary or parallel corpus uses.

1. Change the `xml:lang` attribute of the `<tuv>` tags to the correct [language code ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp){: new_window} for each term or translation.

1. Save the document with the extension `.tmx` and UTF-8 encoding.

### Changing a TMX file to UTF-8 encoding

You can use a number of tools to create or generate TMX files. Often, generated TMX files are UTF-16 encoded by default. The {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} service accepts only UTF-8 encoded TMX files. To change the encoding of a TMX file, complete the following steps:

1. Open the TMX file in a text editor.

1. Change the XML header (if present) from `<?xml ... encoding="utf-16"?>` to `<?xml ... encoding="utf-8"?>`.

1. Save the file with a new name and with UTF-8 encoding output.

Mac users can also change file encoding by updating the XML header of the document as described in step 2, and then running the following command in the Terminal:

```bash
iconv -f utf-16 -t utf-8 <utf-16_file_name.tmx> <new_utf-8_file_name.tmx>
```

## Deleting a custom translation model
{: #deleting-a-custom-model}

To delete a custom translation model, use the [Delete model ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/language-translator/api/v3/curl.html#delete-model) method.

The following command deletes the translation model with model ID `3e7dfdbe-f757-4150-afee-458e71eb93fb`.

```curl
curl --user apikey:{apikey_value} --request DELETE "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/language-translator/api/v3/models/3e7dfdbe-f757-4150-afee-458e71eb93fb?version=2018-05-01"
